### Projects made in the Casinha, my home workshop

Beware - big mess ahead! The folder **Primeiros** contains projects that are newer or more complete. **Segundos** contains other projects. Some projects have already been published, they're listed below. Some projects don't even work, but I kept them as a record, perhaps to revisit later with better knowledge and resources. I plan to reorganize all the relevant stuff in a website someday.


### WARNING:
- Some projects involve Class IV lasers and High Voltage. Always use adequate protection equipment. I'm not responsible for any injury. 
- I'm Brazilian, so most instructions of unpublished stuff will be in Portuguese. Portuguese is a beautiful and rich language, consider learning it some day if you have the chance.
- Some projects contain third party content (like snapshots of webpages or documents written together with colleagues), please do not use these without their permission. Just ask me if in doubt about a specific case.
