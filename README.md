### Projects made in the Casinha, my home workshop

Beware - big mess ahead! The folder **Primeiros** contains projects that are newer or more complete. **Segundos** contains other projects. Some projects have already been published, they're listed below. Some projects don't even work, but I kept them as a record, perhaps to revisit later with better knowledge and resources. I plan to reorganize all the relevant stuff in a website someday.


### WARNING:
- Some projects involve Class IV lasers and High Voltage. Always use adequate protection equipment. I'm not responsible for any injury. 
- I'm Brazilian, so most instructions of unpublished stuff will be in Portuguese. Portuguese is a beautiful and rich language, consider learning it some day if you have the chance.
- Some projects contain third party content (like snapshots of webpages or documens written together with colleagues), please do not use these without their permission.
